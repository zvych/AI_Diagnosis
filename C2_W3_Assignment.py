# # Survival Estimates that Vary with Time
# 
# Welcome to the third assignment of Course 2. In this assignment, we'll use Python to build some of the statistical models we learned this past week to analyze surivival estimates for a dataset of lymphoma patients. We'll also evaluate these models and interpret their outputs. Along the way, you will be learning about the following: 
# 
# - Censored Data
# - Kaplan-Meier Estimates
# - Subgroup Analysis

# ## 1. Import Packages
# 
# We'll first import all the packages that we need for this assignment. 
# 
# - `lifelines` is an open-source library for data analysis.
# - `numpy` is the fundamental package for scientific computing in python.
# - `pandas` is what we'll use to manipulate our data.
# - `matplotlib` is a plotting library.

# In[1]:


import lifelines
import numpy as np
import pandas as pd
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

from util import load_data

from lifelines import KaplanMeierFitter as KM
from lifelines.statistics import logrank_test

from public_tests import *


# <a name='2'></a>
# ## 2. Load the Dataset
# 

# Run the next cell to load the lymphoma data set. 

# In[2]:


data = load_data()


# As always, you first look over your data.

# In[3]:


print("data shape: {}".format(data.shape))
data.head()


# The column `Time` states how long the patient lived before they died or were censored.
# 
# The column `Event` says whether a death was observed or not. `Event` is 1 if the event is observed (i.e. the patient died) and 0 if data was censored.
# 
# Censorship here means that the observation has ended without any observed event.
# For example, let a patient be in a hospital for 100 days at most. If a patient dies after only 44 days, their event will be recorded as `Time` = 44 and `Event` = 1. If a patient walks out after 100 days and dies 3 days later (103 days total), this event is not observed in our process and the corresponding row has `Time` = 100 and `Event` = 0. If a patient survives for 25 years after being admitted, their data for are still `Time` = 100 and `Event` = 0.

# <a name='3'></a>
# ## 3. Censored Data
# 
# We can plot a histogram of the survival times to see in general how long cases survived before censorship or events.

# In[4]:


data.Time.hist();
plt.xlabel("Observation time before death or censorship (days)");
plt.ylabel("Frequency (number of patients)");
# Note that the semicolon at the end of the plotting line
# silences unnecessary textual output - try removing it
# to observe its effect

# ## 4. Survival Estimates
# 
# We'll now try to estimate the survival function:
# 
# $$
# S(t) = P(T > t)
# $$
# 
# To illustrate the strengths of Kaplan Meier, we'll start with a naive estimator of the above survival function. To estimate this quantity, we'll divide the number of people who we know lived past time $t$ by the number of people who were not censored before $t$.
# 
# Formally, let $i$ = 1, ..., $n$ be the cases, and let $T_i$ be the time when $i$ was censored or an event happened. Let $e_i= 1$ if an event was observed for $i$ and 0 otherwise. Then let $X_t = \{i : T_i > t\}$, and let $M_t = \{i : e_i = 1 \text{ or } T_i > t\}$. The estimator you will compute will be:
# 
# $$
# \hat{S}(t) = \frac{|X_t|}{|M_t|}
# $$

# ### Exercise 3 - HomemadeKM
# 
# Next let's compare this with the Kaplan Meier estimate. In the cell below, write a function that computes the Kaplan Meier estimate of $S(t)$ at every distinct time in the dataset. 
# 
# Recall the Kaplan-Meier estimate:
# 
# $$
# S(t) = \prod_{t_i \leq t} (1 - \frac{d_i}{n_i})
# $$
# 
# where $t_i$ are the events observed in the dataset and $d_i$ is the number of deaths at time $t_i$ and $n_i$ is the number of people who we know have survived up to time $t_i$.

# ### Question
# 
# What differences do you observe between the naive estimator and Kaplan-Meier estimator? Do any of our earlier explorations of the dataset help to explain these differences?

# <a name='5'></a>
# ## 5. Subgroup Analysis
# 
# We see that along with Time and Censor, we have a column called `Stage_group`. 
# - A value of 1 in this column denotes a patient with stage III cancer
# - A value of 2 denotes stage IV. 
# 
# We want to compare the survival functions of these two groups.
# 
# This time we'll use the `KaplanMeierFitter` class from `lifelines`. Run the next cell to fit and plot the Kaplan Meier curves for each group. 

# In[24]:


S1 = data[data.Stage_group == 1]
km1 = KM()
km1.fit(S1.loc[:, 'Time'], event_observed = S1.loc[:, 'Event'], label = 'Stage III')

S2 = data[data.Stage_group == 2]
km2 = KM()
km2.fit(S2.loc[:, "Time"], event_observed = S2.loc[:, 'Event'], label = 'Stage IV')

ax = km1.plot(ci_show=False)
km2.plot(ax = ax, ci_show=False)
plt.xlabel('time')
plt.ylabel('Survival probability estimate')
plt.savefig('two_km_curves', dpi=300)


# Let's compare the survival functions at 90, 180, 270, and 360 days

# In[25]:


survivals = pd.DataFrame([90, 180, 270, 360], columns = ['time'])
survivals.loc[:, 'Group 1'] = km1.survival_function_at_times(survivals['time']).values
survivals.loc[:, 'Group 2'] = km2.survival_function_at_times(survivals['time']).values


# In[26]:


survivals


# This makes clear the difference in survival between the Stage III and IV cancer groups in the dataset. 

# <a name='5-1'></a>
# ## 5.1 Bonus: Log-Rank Test
# 
# To say whether there is a statistical difference between the survival curves we can run the log-rank test. This test tells us the probability that we could observe this data if the two curves were the same. The derivation of the log-rank test is somewhat complicated, but luckily `lifelines` has a simple function to compute it. 
# 
# Run the next cell to compute a p-value using `lifelines.statistics.logrank_test`.

# In[27]:


def logrank_p_value(group_1_data, group_2_data):
    result = logrank_test(group_1_data.Time, group_2_data.Time,
                          group_1_data.Event, group_2_data.Event)
    return result.p_value

logrank_p_value(S1, S2)


# If everything is correct, you should see a p value of less than 0.05, which indicates that the difference in the curves is indeed statistically significant.

# # Congratulations!
# 
# You've completed the third assignment of Course 2. You've learned about the Kaplan Meier estimator, a fundamental non-parametric estimator in survival analysis. Next week we'll learn how to take into account patient covariates in our survival estimates!
